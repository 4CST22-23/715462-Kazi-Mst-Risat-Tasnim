    <p style="position: relative;">
      Water pollution is the contamination of water
      bodies(e.g.lakes,rivers,oceans,aquifers and groundwater). Water
      pollution occurs when pollutants are directly or indirectly discharged
      into water bodies without adequate treatment to remove harmful
      compounds.
      <br />
      Water pollution affects plants and organisms living in these bodies of
      water.In almost all cases the effects is damaging not only to species
      and populations,but also to the natural biological communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs, and
      groundwater, with harmful substances. This pollution can occur through various sources, including:
    <ol>
      <li>Sewage Discharges: Untreated or partially treated wastewater from households, industries, and agricultural
        activities.</li>
      <li>Industrial Activities: Chemicals and pollutants released from industrial processes, such as manufacturing,
        mining, and energy production.</li>
      <li>Agricultural Activities: Fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste from farming and livestock operations.</li>
      <li>Urban Runoff: Stormwater runoff carrying pollutants from urban areas, including road salts, oil, grease,
        chemicals, and debris.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Consequences of Water Pollution:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Degradation of Aquatic Ecosystems: Harmful effects on aquatic plants and animals, leading to reduced
        biodiversity
        and ecosystem services.</li>
      <li>Waterborne Diseases: Contamination of drinking water sources, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases, such
        as</li>
      <li>cholera, hepatitis A, and dysentery.</li>
      <li>Economic Impacts: Reduced economic growth, poverty, and loss of livelihoods due to degraded water quality and
        decreased access to clean water.</li>
      <li>Human Health Risks: Exposure to polluted water can cause a range of health problems, including skin
        irritation,
        respiratory issues, and increased risk of cancer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Types of Water Pollutants:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Bacteria: Faecal bacteria, such as E. coli, from sewage and agricultural runoff.
      </li>
      <li> Viruses: Enteric viruses, like norovirus and rotavirus, from human and animal waste.
      </li>
      <li> Parasites: Protozoa, such as giardia and cryptosporidium, from contaminated water sources.
      </li>
      <li> Chemicals: Fertilizers, pesticides, heavy metals, and industrial chemicals from various sources.
      </li>
      <li> Plastics: Microplastics and macroplastics from litter, industrial processes, and agricultural activities.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Examples of Water Pollution in Bangladesh:</p>

    Buriganga River: One of the most polluted rivers in Bangladesh, with high levels of faecal bacteria and industrial
    pollutants.
    Ganges River: The sacred river is heavily polluted, with faecal bacteria levels exceeding 31 million per 100
    millilitres in some areas.
    Groundwater: Contamination of groundwater sources, including arsenic and fluoride, affecting millions of people.
    Solutions to Water Pollution:

    Improved Wastewater Treatment: Upgrading wastewater treatment facilities and implementing proper sewage
    management.
    Source Control: Reducing pollutant inputs from industrial, agricultural, and urban activities.
    Water Conservation: Promoting water-efficient practices and reducing water demand.
    Public Education: Raising awareness about water pollution and its consequences, as well as promoting individual
    actions to reduce pollution.
    Policy and Regulation: Strengthening laws and regulations to prevent and mitigate water pollution.
    Local Businesses and Organizations:
    Pureit Water Purifier: A water purification company providing clean drinking water solutions.
    Water & Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP): An organization working to improve water and sanitation services for
    urban poor communities.
    Magic Island: A water treatment plant providing clean water solutions for local communities.
