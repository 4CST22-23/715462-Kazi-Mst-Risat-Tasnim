        Noice pollution is the disturbing or excessive noice that may harm the
        activity or balance of human or animal life. The source of most outdoor
        noice worldwide is mainly caused by machines and transportation
        systems,motor,vehicies,aircraft and trains. Outdoor noice is summarized
        by the world environmental noice. Poor urban planning may give rise to
        noice pollution,since side-by-side industrial and residential buildings
        can result in noice pollution in the residential areas.
        <br />
        Noice pollution affects boyh health and behavior. Unwanted sound (noice)
        can damage psychological health. noice pollution can cause
        trouble,hypertention,high stress levels, tinnitus,hearing loss,sleep
        disturbances and other harmful effects.

        Noise pollution is a growing concern in urban areas, including Dhaka,
        Bangladesh. It refers to unwanted or disturbing sounds that affect the
        health and well-being of humans and wildlife. The sources of noise
        pollution in Dhaka include: Traffic horns: Hydraulic horns can reach
        levels of 120 decibels, causing hearing injuries and discomfort.
        Construction sites: Heavy machinery and equipment generate loud noises,
        disrupting residential areas. Loudspeakers: Used in social occasions,
        seminars, and public gatherings, they often exceed acceptable noise
        levels. Vehicles: Cars, buses, and motorbikes contribute to noise
        pollution with their horns, exhausts, and tires. Industrial activities:
        Factories, generators, and machinery produce constant noise, affecting
        nearby residential areas. Health Impacts Noise pollution has severe
        health consequences, including: Hearing loss: Prolonged exposure to loud
        noises can cause permanent hearing damage. Cardiovascular disease:
        Chronic noise exposure is linked to increased blood pressure, heart
        rate, and cardiovascular risk. Sleep disturbances: Noise pollution
        disrupts sleep patterns, leading to fatigue, irritability, and decreased
        cognitive function. Mental health: Noise pollution can contribute to
        anxiety, stress, and depression. Environmental Impacts Noise pollution
        also affects wildlife, including: Communication disruption:
        Anthropogenic noises interfere with animal communication, reproduction,
        and predator-prey relationships. Habitat disruption: Noise pollution can
        alter animal behavior, leading to changes in habitat use and population
        dynamics. Regulations and Enforcement While Bangladesh has laws and
        regulations in place to control noise pollution, such as the Noise
        Pollution (Control) Rules 2006, enforcement is often lacking. The High
        Court banned hydraulic horns in motor vehicles in 2017, but
        implementation has been limited. Solutions To mitigate noise pollution
        in Dhaka, consider the following: Enforce existing regulations:
        Strengthen enforcement of noise pollution laws and regulations.
        Implement noise-reducing technologies: Encourage the use of quieter
        construction equipment and vehicles. Raise awareness: Educate the public
        about the impacts of noise pollution and promote responsible noise
        management practices. Designate quiet zones: Establish noise-free areas,
        such as hospitals and residential zones, and enforce noise limits. By
        addressing noise pollution, we can create a healthier, more livable
        environment for both humans and wildlife in Dhaka.
