        Air pollution is the introduction of
        particulates,biological,molecules,or other harmful materials into the
        Earth's atmosphere,possibly causing disease,death to humans,damage to
        other living orgainsm such as food crops,or the natural or built
        environment.
        <br />
        Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of health
        condition including respiratory infections ,heart disease,COPD,stroke
        and lung cancer.

      <p>
        Air pollution Air pollution is a significant threat to human health,
        causing an estimated 7 million premature deaths worldwide every year.
        According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 9 out of 10 people
        breathe air containing high levels of pollutants, with low- and
        middle-income countries suffering the most. Causes of Air Pollution Air
        pollution is primarily caused by: Energy consumption: Burning fossil
        fuels for energy and transportation releases pollutants like particulate
        matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide
        into the atmosphere. Household combustion: Indoor air pollution from
        cooking and heating using polluting fuels like biomass, coal, and
        kerosene affects millions of people, particularly in low-income
        households. Industrial activities: Industrial processes, such as
        manufacturing and waste incineration, also contribute to air pollution.
        Health Impacts Air pollution is linked to various health problems,
        including: Respiratory diseases: Exposure to particulate matter and
        ozone can cause asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
        and lung cancer. Cardiovascular disease: Air pollution can increase the
        risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular conditions.
        Neurological effects: Exposure to air pollutants has been linked to
        cognitive impairment, neurological damage, and increased risk of
        dementia. Solutions To mitigate the effects of air pollution, it is
        essential to: Transition to clean energy: Shift towards renewable energy
        sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce fossil fuel combustion.
        Improve household energy: Promote the use of cleaner fuels and
        technologies, like electric stoves and improved biomass cookstoves, for
        household energy needs. Enhance industrial pollution control: Implement
        effective pollution control measures in industries, such as emissions
        standards and monitoring systems. Strengthen air quality monitoring and
        regulation: Establish robust air quality monitoring networks and enforce
        regulations to reduce pollution levels. Global Efforts The World Health
        Organization (WHO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and
        other international organizations are working together to address air
        pollution. National governments and local authorities are also
        implementing policies and initiatives to reduce air pollution and
        improve air quality. Key Statistics 7 million premature deaths annually
        attributed to air pollution (WHO) 99% of the global population breathes
        air exceeding WHO guideline limits (WHO) Air pollution is responsible
        for 1 in 8 deaths globally (WHO) Energy poverty and indoor air pollution
        affect 2.4 billion people worldwide (WHO) By understanding the causes
        and health impacts of air pollution, we can work together to reduce
        emissions, improve air quality, and protect public health.
